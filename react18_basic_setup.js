// A basic setup for React 18 (this would be the entry point of your app, likely a Main.jsx or Index.jsx file)
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// Another way:
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.querySelector("#root"));

root.render(<App />);

/*
Here's an ASCII diagram of how app.jsx, index.css, index.js, index.html, app.css and components are connected. The diagram only shows top level information and doesn't go into detail about the components themselves.

index.html (root element with id="root" where the app is rendered)
  |
  |__ index.js (this file - we import react, ReactDOM, App and render the app in the root element)
        |
        |__ app.jsx (this is where we import the components and use them to build the app)
        |     |
        |     |__ components (various JSX components used in app.jsx)
        |
        |__ index.css (global styles)
        |
        |__ app.css (styles specific to app.jsx)

Please note that this is a simplified representation. The actual connections might be more complex depending on the structure and logic of your application.
