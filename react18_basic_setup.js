// A basic setup for React 18 (this would be the entry point of your app, likely a Main.jsx or Index.jsx file)
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

/*
Here's an ASCII diagram of how app.jsx, index.css, index.js, index.html, app.css and components are connected. The diagram only shows top level information and doesn't go into detail about the components themselves.

index.html
  |
  |__ index.js
        |
        |__ app.jsx (this is where we import the components and use them to build the app)
        |     |
        |     |__ components (various JSX components used in app.jsx)
        |
        |__ index.css (global styles)
        |
        |__ app.css (styles specific to app.jsx)

Please note that this is a simplified representation. The actual connections might be more complex depending on the structure and logic of your application.
